    <p>
        Cricket is the world's most popular bat-and-ball game, it is played between two teams of eleven players each on a field 
        at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 
        The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the bowler, "bowls" (propels) the ball from one end of the pitch towards 
        the wicket at the other end, with an "over" being completed once they have legally done so six times. The batting side has one player 
        at each end of the pitch, with the player at the opposite end of the pitch from the bowler aiming to strike the ball with a bat. 
        The batting side scores runs when either the bowler unfairly bowls the ball to the batter, the ball reaches the boundary of the field, 
        or the two batters swap ends of the pitch, which results in one run. The fielding side's aim is to prevent run-scoring and dismiss each 
        batter (so they are "out", and are said to have "lost their wicket"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the bowled ball hits 
        the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching a hit ball before it touches the ground, or hitting a wicket 
        with the ball before a batter can cross the crease line in front of the wicket to complete a run. When ten batters have been dismissed,
         the innings ends and the teams swap roles. At the end of the game, the team that scored more runs wins, provided that the other team has 
         completed its one or two scheduled innings. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.

    <h3>history Of Cricket</h3>
    
    <pre>
The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century. Having originated in
south-east England, it became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and 
developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 
the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the 
world's second most popular spectator sport after association football (soccer)
Internationally, cricket is governed by the [International Cricket Council (ICC)], which has over 
one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.
The game's rules are defined in the "Laws of cricket". The game has various formats, ranging 
from one-day cricket played over a few hours to Test matches which can last up to five days.
Cricket was probably created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an 
area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across Kent and Sussex. 
The first definite written reference is from the end of the 16th century.
There have been several speculations about the game's origins, including some that it was created 
in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is from 1300 and concerns the 
future King Edward II playing at "creag and other games" in both Westminster and Newenden. It has 
been suggested that "creag" was an Old English word for cricket, but expert opinion is that it was 
an early spelling of "craic", meaning "fun and games in general".
