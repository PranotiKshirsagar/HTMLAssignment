    <h2>Information about sport</h2>
    <div>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and
         skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.Sports can, through casual or
        organized participation, improve one's physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through 
        to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports such as racing,
        many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, 
            The contest (a match) is between two sides, 
        each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking 
        methods to ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion. Many sports leagues 
        make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</div>

        <pre> Sports can be classified in many ways, as they are so numerous and varied.
