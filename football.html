        <b>history Of Football</b>
        <pre>
    The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican cultures 
    for over 3,000 years ago. It was by the Aztecs called Tchatali, although various versions of the game were spread over large regions. 
    In some ritual occasions, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods. 
    A unique feature of the Mesoamerican ball game versions was a bouncing ball made of rubber â€“ no other early culture had access to rubber.

    The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place In China in the 3rd and 2nd century BC under the name cuju.
    Cuju was played with a round ball (stitched leather with fur or feathers inside) on an area of a square. 
    A modified form of this game later spread to Japan and was by the name of kemari practiced under ceremonial forms.
    Perhaps even older cuju was Marn Gook, played by Aboriginal Australians and according to white emigrants in the 1800s a ball
    game primarily involving kicking. The ball was made by encased leaves or roots. The rules are mostly unknown, but as with many 
    other early versions of the game keeping the ball in the air was probably a chief feature.
