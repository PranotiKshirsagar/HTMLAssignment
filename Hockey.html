        Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, 
        sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.

There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not. In order to help make 
the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey" is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", 
"roller hockey", "rink hockey", or "floor hockey".

In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a 
disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk 
(still referred to as a "puck") with a hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified 
in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s 
to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The floor
 game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled 
 off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the 
 same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.

    <h3>history Of Hockey</h3>

        Hockey and its Origins

The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago 
and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around 2,000BC. 
Various museums offer evidence that a form of the game was played by the Romans and Greeks as well as by the Aztecs several centuries before 
Columbus arrived in the New World.
The modern game of hockey emerged in England in the mid-18th century and is largely attributed to the growth of public schools, such as Eton.
The first Hockey Association was formed in the UK in 1876 and drew up the first formal set of rules. The original association survived 
for just six years but, in 1886, it was revived by nine founding member clubs.

Hockey and the Olympics
The inaugural Olympic Hockey Competition for men was held in London in 1908 with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales competing 
separately. With the addition of Germany and France, the competition ran with six teams.
After having made its first appearance at the London Games, hockey was subsequently dropped from the 1912 Stockholm Games after 
host nations were granted control over ‘optional sports’. It reappeared in 1920 in Antwerp after pressure from Belgian hockey advocates 
before being omitted again in Paris in 1924.
The formation of the International Hockey Federation in 1924 was not soon enough for the Paris Olympics but it did grant hockey 
re-entry in Amsterdam in 1928. Hockey has been on the programme ever since, with women's hockey included for the first time in Moscow in 1980.
